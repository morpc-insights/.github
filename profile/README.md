# MORPC Insights Support files
The repositories included in this GitHub organization contain assets to support the content displayed in the [MORPC Insights Platform](https://morpc.org/insights).

In general, each repository contains data, metadata, scripts, images, and configuration information related to one of the "tileset" on the platform.  The specific contents of the repositories are not strictly enforced, but you are likely to find the following contents:

  - README.md - Provides an overview of the contents of the repository
  - data_config.yaml - If present, this file indicates that repository is intended to serve as a "data kit".  A data kit is meant to contain a dataset, plus the minimum collection of information needed to use the dataset effectively, including metadata and documentation.  data_config.yaml provides a machine readable description of the contents of the repository which are associated with the data kit..  The requirements for a data kit are described in full in the [Data Kit Design Specification](https://github.com/morpc/morpc-insights/blob/main/doc/Design%20Specification%20-%20Insights%20Data%20Kit.docx)
  - presentation_config.yaml - If present, this file indicates that repository is intended to serve as a "presentation kit".  A presentation kit is meant to describe a means of presenting (i.e. visualizing) data and may include example visualizations.  Typically a presentation kit is prepared to accompany a data kit and describes visualization(s) appropriate for the data in the data kit.  presentation_config.yaml provides a machine readable description of the contents of the repository which are related to the presentation kit.  The requirements for a data kit are described in full in the [Presentation Kit Design Specification](https://github.com/morpc/morpc-insights/blob/main/doc/Design%20Specification%20-%20Insights%20Data%20Kit.docx)
